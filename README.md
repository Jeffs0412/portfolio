The project is built using functional components in React. Each component represents a specific section or feature of the website and is located in separate JavaScript files. Here's a brief overview of the components and their corresponding files:

- **Home**: Displays the introductory section of the website. (Located in `home.js`)
- **Projects**: Shows a collection of projects with their details and links. (Located in `projects.js`)
